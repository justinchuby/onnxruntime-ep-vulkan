//! Weight-only quantization — `MatMulNBits` and the block-quantized dequant path.
//!
//! # Why this module is not optional
//!
//! Justin's 2026-07-28 ruling makes an int4 LLM the *functional requirement*, not a later tuning
//! pass: "matmulnbits那些 都要做". `OP_COVERAGE.md` §3.2 is the evidence — the Qwen3 graph people
//! actually run is int4, every dense projection in it is a `com.microsoft.MatMulNBits`, and an EP
//! that declines them shreds the graph into ~200 islands. So this module is on the critical path
//! to "Qwen3.5 runs end-to-end", and §11 is equally clear that it is the expensive kind of work:
//! a `QGEMM` has no template to inherit from.
//!
//! # What exists here today
//!
//! Rows, contrib schema fingerprints, and claim predicates that are *exactly* as strict as the
//! kernels will be. The kernels themselves are [`XL_KERNEL`]-staged. That ordering is deliberate
//! and is the same argument as everywhere else in `ops/`: the claim policy is where the
//! correctness risk lives, it is testable without a GPU, and writing it first means the kernel is
//! written against a decided contract rather than the other way round.
//!
//! # The claim policy, and why it is narrow
//!
//! `OP_COVERAGE.md` §8.1 sets it: `bits ∈ {4, 8}`, `block_size` a power of two in `[16, 128]`,
//! `g_idx` absent. Those are the forms the ORT GenAI builder emits (`quant_config.py`: dense block
//! 32, 128 for TRT-RTX). `g_idx` (act-order) makes the `B` access pattern data-dependent and
//! destroys the coalesced load that is the entire point of the kernel, so it declines rather than
//! being handled slowly.
//!
//! # Never materialize a dequantized weight tensor
//!
//! Stated here because it is a property of the *op*, not of one kernel: int4 exists so a 1.7B
//! model fits in 1 GB, and dequantizing `B` into device memory before the GEMM gives that back. The
//! unpack happens in registers (decode/GEMV) or in shared memory per tile (prefill/GEMM). This is
//! the load-bearing constraint in the kernel spec handed to Switch.
