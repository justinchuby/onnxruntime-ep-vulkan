### [SUMMARY] Sessions 1–4: tracing, harness, producer provenance, portability, two fabricated speedups caught (2026-07-28–2026-07-30)

**Sessions 1–3 (archived):** `onnx-runtime-tracer` integrated. Vulkan-specific span phases defined. GPU timestamp-query requirements routed to Switch (`DeviceInfo` must carry `timestamp_period_ns`, `timestamp_valid_bits`). `bench/` and `docs/PERF.md` built with no performance numbers (no kernel executed at that point). OQ-12 anchor: `matmulnbits_q4_b32_K4096_N4096`, ≥1.5× bar measured at that case only. `bench/transfer_calibration.py` sweeps doubling byte staircase, fits fixed+bandwidth model, prints paste-ready Rust literal. MVS constants replaced per device via review. `bench/environment.py` stamps OS/CPU/ORT/EP/Vulkan/env-vars at run start.

**Session 4 — portability envelope (2026-07-30):**
- **D-N24** — Portability floor is §7.2 (16 KiB shared, 256 invocations), not the smaller local GPU. Iris Xe is UMA proxy for mobile memory model, not for mobile shared-memory budget. A 32 KiB tile passing on Iris Xe is not portability evidence.
- **D-N25** — `bench/portability.py`: `evaluate(Configuration) → Verdict` in {`portable`, `needs-fallback`, `unknown`}; `quotable_as_ep_behaviour` true only for `portable`. Every row is `unknown` today (engine does not report tile shape or workgroup size). `fits_device(config, shared, invocations)` uses reported limits, not constants.
- **D-N26** — UMA and discrete transfer models may not be blended. `portability.transfer_model_merge_refusal()` closes the obvious path.
- **D-N27** — Routing to Switch: engine must report `tile_config`, workgroup size, shared-memory bytes, and memory path (UMA mapped write vs staging copy). Until then, portability column is honest but empty.
- **D-N28** — Two fabricated speedups caught: 1.70× (ORT 1.27 prints failure without raising; result was CPU vs CPU); 1.45× (EP loads under ORT 1.28, declines everything — all "vulkan" columns are CPU EP). Neither claimed. `bench/README.md` records both as "the 1.70× that wasn't" and "the 1.45× that wasn't."

**Current state:**
- `pytest bench/` — 50 passed (11 new portability tests).
- No real Vulkan bench row yet — no kernel has executed through the bench harness.
- All timing rows are CPU-only, clearly labelled.
- First quotable Vulkan row: after Switch reports tile_config + workgroup size in `DeviceInfo`, and `dispatches_executed > 0` in counters file.
- `SUBGROUP_SIZE_IS_GUARANTEED=False` constant present — both local GPUs happen to report 32, not a guarantee.
- Standing rule: metric of record is the triple `(claimed_coverage, island_count, largest_island_flops)`, never any component alone.

## 📌 Cross-agent context — Round 4 (2026-07-30T02:49:12-07:00)

### Worktree layout and inbox portability constraint
The team works in git worktrees: `squad/switch` at `C:\Users\justinchu\dev\ep-vulkan-switch`, `squad/mouse` at `C:\Users\justinchu\dev\ep-vulkan-mouse`, `squad/tank` at `C:\Users\justinchu\dev\ep-vulkan-tank`, with `main` as the integration tree. `.squad/decisions/inbox/` is **gitignored** — records written in a worktree do NOT travel with the branch. The inbox in `main` is authoritative.

### Vulkan SDK path
`C:\VulkanSDK\1.4.350.0` — installed but **not on the default PATH**. `glslc` discovery must search this path; `VULKAN_SDK` env var is the canonical pointer.

### Local hardware — both GPUs pass the §7.2 gate
- Intel Iris Xe: Vulkan 1.4.309, UMA, `subgroup_size=32`, 32 KiB shared. Spec-conformance oracle. Do not special-case Intel.
- RTX 4060 Laptop: Vulkan 1.4.325, discrete, `subgroup_size=32`, 48 KiB shared.
- Lavapipe (CI): `subgroup_size=8`, 32 KiB shared, `is_uma=true`. CI exercises the mobile-warp path. LVP2 retracted.

### ORT's planner hands back interior pointers from run 2 onward
Memory-pattern planner does not engage on run 1. From run 2 onward hands back interior pointers. 52 observed, `pointers_in_guard_band=0`. Gate: `epctl --check-counters <file> --require-dispatches 1`.

### Execution counters file is the instrument for "did anything execute"
`ONNXRUNTIME_EP_VULKAN_COUNTERS_FILE` — always-on JSON. `dispatches_executed > 0` is the only reliable indicator.

### `push_next` must rebind, never discard
`let _ = props2.push_next(..)` silently discards pNext chain. Rebind, never discard.

### First real execution: 45 ops Live, 161 nodes claimed on Phi-3.5
`ENGINE_ACCEPTS_RUNTIME_EXTENTS=true`. M0 not declared — open: validation positive control, CI lanes green.

### Performance metric is a TRIPLE
`(claimed_op_coverage, island_count, largest_island_flops)` per producer at version. Portability floor = §7.2. `SUBGROUP_SIZE_IS_GUARANTEED=False`.
