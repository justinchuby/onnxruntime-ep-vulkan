### [SUMMARY] Sessions 1–6: extension availability, capability set, CI root causes, hardware matrix, LVP2 retraction (2026-07-28–2026-07-30)

**Sessions 1–2 (archived):** OQ-1 measured: `VK_KHR_synchronization2` at 68.57% on Android, `VK_EXT_subgroup_size_control` at 85.88%. Option B (Khronos layer shim) rejected; retained only as optional integrator deployment note. Wgpu/Dawn/Godot claim of Vulkan 1.2 requirement found false — these use extensions, not 1.2 core. OQ-12 hardware experiment defined.

**Session 3 (archived) — CI root causes:**
Windows CI: `VK_ICD_FILENAMES` env var ignored under elevation — must register ICD in `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Khronos\Vulkan\Drivers`. Linux failure was a compile error (not a Vulkan problem); `glslc` arrives via LunarG apt repo.

**Session 4 (2026-07-29T09:19:35-07:00) — hardware matrix:**
First execution-derived hardware data. Both CI lanes CI-VERIFIED (Linux llvmpipe, Windows lavapipe). Both local GPUs local-dev-verified. Intel Iris Xe is the spec-conformance oracle — do not special-case Intel failures. UMA is a first-class platform column (Intel Iris Xe and mobile are UMA; results on Iris Xe are a closer mobile proxy for memory model than RTX 4060). Memory model column added to platform matrix. LVP2 initially recorded (lavapipe `supportedStages=0`) — but see retraction below.

**Session 5 (2026-07-29T09:39:59-07:00) — cross-platform standing directive:**
Cross-platform generality is structural, not a review step. Derive from reported limits. Every `cfg` is a portability hazard (`tests/portability.rs`). Intel is the spec oracle; Intel failures predict MoltenVK failures. No required extensions per §7.2.

**Session 6 (2026-07-29T20:26:56-07:00) — LVP2 RETRACTED:**
LVP2 retracted. Mesa 23.2.1 lavapipe supports subgroup BASIC+ARITHMETIC+BALLOT+SHUFFLE+SHUFFLE_RELATIVE+QUAD in compute, `subgroup_size=8`. The original `supportedStages=0` was the discarded `push_next` chain — our bug, not a device fact. PLATFORMS.md LVP2 entry updated to retraction notice. Lavapipe is UMA (`is_uma=true`, single DEVICE_LOCAL heap), `maxComputeSharedMemorySize=32 KiB`. CI now exercises the mobile-warp path (lavapipe `subgroup_size=8` vs local 32).

**Current state:**
PLATFORMS.md current. Both CI lanes verified. Hardware matrix up to date. M0 criterion 9 met (LVP2 retracted). OQ-12 experiment design defined; hardware borrow needed after M0 for Adreno/Mali. Intel Iris Xe is the spec oracle; every Intel failure is a real portability signal.

## 📌 Cross-agent context — Round 4 (2026-07-30T02:49:12-07:00)

### Worktree layout and inbox portability constraint
The team works in git worktrees: `squad/switch` at `C:\Users\justinchu\dev\ep-vulkan-switch`, `squad/mouse` at `C:\Users\justinchu\dev\ep-vulkan-mouse`, `squad/tank` at `C:\Users\justinchu\dev\ep-vulkan-tank`, with `main` as the integration tree. `.squad/decisions/inbox/` is **gitignored** — records written in a worktree do NOT travel with the branch. The inbox in `main` is authoritative.

### Vulkan SDK path
`C:\VulkanSDK\1.4.350.0` — installed but **not on the default PATH**. `glslc` discovery must search this path; `VULKAN_SDK` env var is the canonical pointer.

### Local hardware — both GPUs pass the §7.2 gate
- Intel Iris Xe: Vulkan 1.4.309, UMA, `subgroup_size=32`, 32 KiB shared. Spec-conformance oracle. Do not special-case Intel.
- RTX 4060 Laptop: Vulkan 1.4.325, discrete, `subgroup_size=32`, 48 KiB shared.
- Lavapipe (CI): `subgroup_size=8`, 32 KiB shared, `is_uma=true`. CI exercises the mobile-warp path. LVP2 retracted.

### ORT's planner hands back interior pointers from run 2 onward
Memory-pattern planner does not engage on run 1. From run 2 onward hands back interior pointers. 52 observed, `pointers_in_guard_band=0`. Gate: `epctl --check-counters <file> --require-dispatches 1`.

### Execution counters file is the instrument for "did anything execute"
`ONNXRUNTIME_EP_VULKAN_COUNTERS_FILE` — always-on JSON. `dispatches_executed > 0` is the only reliable indicator.

### `push_next` must rebind, never discard
`let _ = props2.push_next(..)` silently discards pNext chain. Rebind, never discard.

### First real execution: 45 ops Live, 161 nodes claimed on Phi-3.5
`ENGINE_ACCEPTS_RUNTIME_EXTENTS=true`. M0 not declared — open: validation positive control, CI lanes green.

### Performance metric is a TRIPLE
`(claimed_op_coverage, island_count, largest_island_flops)` per producer at version. Portability floor = §7.2. `SUBGROUP_SIZE_IS_GUARANTEED=False`.
