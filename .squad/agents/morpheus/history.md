### [SUMMARY] Sessions 1–22: design, OQ rulings, contrib admission, M0 assessment, R6/R7/R8, §8.8 (2026-07-28–2026-07-30)

**Sessions 1–6 (archived):** DESIGN.md and README.md produced. Capability set baseline: Vulkan ≥1.1 + sync2 + subgroup_size_control (either 1.3 core or as extensions). Milestones M0–M3. `com.microsoft` contrib domain admitted under constraints C1–C7. OQ-3 ruled: registry only, no buffer device address. OQ-4 ruled: hard Vulkan SDK build dependency (supersedes checked-in SPIR-V fallback). §9.1.2 established.

**Sessions 7–9 — coverage is producer-relative; §8.5:**
T3 first kernel defined. §8.5 second strengthening: "model file is the fact, builder source is intent." Metric of record: `(claimed_op_coverage, island_count, largest_island_flops)`. Producer+version required. §7.2 device gate frozen: five requirements, no required extensions.

**Session 10 — first dispatch and disclosure failure mode:**
§9.1.2 rewritten after first dispatch: three qualifiers (one kernel, one OS, no ORT-mediated path yet). Disclosure risk inverted — from overclaiming to understating.

**Session 11 — the file vs the builder:**
§8.5 third strengthening: "builder source is intent; the model file is the fact." Producer revision required in every claim. C2 opset-based checking cannot see behavioural corrections shipped without opset bump — documented blind spot.

**Session 12 — manufactured evidence and probe failure:**
R6: a decision can be right, reasonably reached, and rest on manufactured evidence. Three rules for load-bearing reasons in decision records. §7.9 capability probe discipline (five rules). Corrected: `push_next` chain bug (D-S12-01), `is_uma` predicate (D-S12b-01).

**Session 13 — R7 and the skip contradiction:**
R7: instruments fabricate negatives; "absence of instrument must not read as success." Three-layer skip contradiction: OnceLock dead, profiling JSON crashed Intel, per-op `live` flag vacuous pass. "Derive, do not declare."

**Session 14 — criteria and the standard:**
M0 criterion 3 NOT met: "no errors surfaced" = layer not loaded. M0 criterion 8 MET: legacy barrier backend executed (46/28 bit-exact, both devices, both backends). M0 criterion 9: PLATFORMS.md LVP2 needs retraction (done). Six criteria met, one partial, one not met. A standard that yields the first time it costs something was never a standard.

**Session 15 — first-match ceiling:**
§8.7: template evidence (similarity is not a measurement). The 100 staged nodes had never reached the shape check — shape viability unknown. R8: a decline code names the first failing check, not the only one.

**Session 16 — §8.8 dynamic shapes ahead of kernels:**
§8.8 RULING: dynamic-shape support is a claim-path capability, moves ahead of kernels. `REQUIRE_STATIC_SHAPES` → `ENGINE_ACCEPTS_RUNTIME_EXTENTS` (inverted). OQ-15: re-record per shape for M1. M1 gains second-token criterion. §10.0.1 R8 added.

**Current state:**
M0 open: validation positive control (criterion 3) + CI lanes. All architectural rulings current. §8.8 governs the next phase. Risks R5 (rationale corrected), R6, R7, R8 all in §10.0.1. C2 blind-spot re: no-opset-bump behavioural corrections documented in §8.3.

## 📌 Cross-agent context — Round 4 (2026-07-30T02:49:12-07:00)

### Worktree layout and inbox portability constraint
The team works in git worktrees: `squad/switch` at `C:\Users\justinchu\dev\ep-vulkan-switch`, `squad/mouse` at `C:\Users\justinchu\dev\ep-vulkan-mouse`, `squad/tank` at `C:\Users\justinchu\dev\ep-vulkan-tank`, with `main` as the integration tree. `.squad/decisions/inbox/` is **gitignored** — records written in a worktree do NOT travel with the branch. The inbox in `main` is authoritative.

### Vulkan SDK path
`C:\VulkanSDK\1.4.350.0` — installed but **not on the default PATH**. `glslc` discovery must search this path; `VULKAN_SDK` env var is the canonical pointer.

### Local hardware — both GPUs pass the §7.2 gate
- Intel Iris Xe: Vulkan 1.4.309, UMA, `subgroup_size=32`, 32 KiB shared. Spec-conformance oracle. Do not special-case Intel.
- RTX 4060 Laptop: Vulkan 1.4.325, discrete, `subgroup_size=32`, 48 KiB shared.
- Lavapipe (CI): `subgroup_size=8`, 32 KiB shared, `is_uma=true`. CI exercises the mobile-warp path. LVP2 retracted.

### ORT's planner hands back interior pointers from run 2 onward
Memory-pattern planner does not engage on run 1. From run 2 onward hands back interior pointers. 52 observed, `pointers_in_guard_band=0`. Gate: `epctl --check-counters <file> --require-dispatches 1`.

### Execution counters file is the instrument for "did anything execute"
`ONNXRUNTIME_EP_VULKAN_COUNTERS_FILE` — always-on JSON. `dispatches_executed > 0` is the only reliable indicator.

### `push_next` must rebind, never discard
`let _ = props2.push_next(..)` silently discards pNext chain. Rebind, never discard.

### First real execution: 45 ops Live, 161 nodes claimed on Phi-3.5
`ENGINE_ACCEPTS_RUNTIME_EXTENTS=true`. M0 not declared — open: validation positive control, CI lanes green.

### Performance metric is a TRIPLE
`(claimed_op_coverage, island_count, largest_island_flops)` per producer at version. Portability floor = §7.2. `SUBGROUP_SIZE_IS_GUARANTEED=False`.
